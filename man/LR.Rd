\description{Log-Rank test between an observed and an expected survival curve}

\usage{
LR(futime, status, age, sex, entry_date, ratetable = survexp.fr)
}

\arguments{
  \item{futime}{follow-up time of the subjects in days}
  \item{status}{0 if censored or 1 if dead at \code{futime}}
  \item{age}{age in days}
  \item{sex}{\code{"male"} or \code{"female"}}
  \item{entry_date}{entry date in the study}
  \item{ratetable}{a table of event rates, such as \code{survexp.fr} or \code{survexp.us}}
}

\details{
The Log-Rank is calculated as:
\deqn{LR = (O-E)^2/E}
where \eqn{O} is the observed number of deaths and \eqn{E} is the expected number based on the patients' characteristics (sex, age and entry date in the study). 
It follows a Khi-2 distribution with one degree of freedom, which allows to compute its p-value.

\value{A list containing the observed number of deaths, the expected number of deaths, the Log-Rank statistic and its p-value}
